Working with a file system is not always easy. It often requires a lot of organization in order to name your files properly and put them in appropriate folders. This simply is not for everybody.

Discover FindMe. This dropbox-style application will allow you dump all of your files in the cloud while keeping them organized. Our advanced analysis tool will parse files and pictures (using the Clarifai API) for you to easily retrieve all you want, when you want it.

Don't remember how you named your file? No problem, as long as you remember a small detail about it, FindMe will get you want you want.

### Development
In 24 hours, we managed to do a lot, but not everything. A cloud based file system requires a very complex architecture which would require many days to design. As such, this application does not support user accounts yet, and the files are not safely stored online. Furthermore, only .txt, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .gif files can be anaylzed by FindMe. The goal was to show that the system works and that more file types could be added in the future.

### Built With
Java PHP CSS MySQL, JavaFX, Clarifai API
